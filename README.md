# uma-trainer
umazing! a spark grinder for umamusume: pretty derby
- greedy auto-runner
- made for spark farming using template matching and OCR
- plays "good enough" to run for you. turn it on and leave

## Roadmap

### Completed
- template matching for UI detection
- card detection in training regions
- detect support level
- detect unity training + spirit burst
- mouse/keyboard control with pyautogui
- decision making calculations (primitive)

### To-do
- event choice (requires databse. C# / EF Core...?)
- race planning
- database population for cards
- refactor so not everything is stuffed in main
- scale to resolutions outside of 16:9 (evenutally)
